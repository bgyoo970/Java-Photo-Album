We did our testing in the data directory under the PhotoAlbum45 directory. All sample user data are in the data directory. If this directory does not exist, our program creates such a directory. Each user has their own .txt file -- <userID>.txt -- and we also stored the user list array into its own .txt file as well called userList.txt
We tested through eclipse by running the main program in CmdView.java within the cs213.photoAlbum.simpleview
