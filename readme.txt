We did our testing in the data directory under the PhotoAlbum45 directory. All sample user data are in the data directory. If this directory does not exist, our program creates such a directory. Each user has their own .txt file -- <userID>.txt -- and we also stored the user list array into its own .txt file as well called userList.txt
We tested through eclipse by running the main program in CmdView.java within the cs213.photoAlbum.simpleview

We did the testing on Michelle's computer so the complete path of the project is "/home/michelle/Documents/workspace/PhotoAlbum45". We also placed various .jpg files in different directories on her computer to check if our program could access them.
